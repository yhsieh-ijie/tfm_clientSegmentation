# Client Segmentation Analysis using RFM variables
This is part of my master final thesis which aims to carry out client segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) variables in the sample datasets provided by the company Up Spain.

I used 2 client segmentation methods in this analysis. One is the traditional method that give scores to each clients based on the TFM variables, and then group clients based on the total scores.

The other method is to use K-Means clustering technique and let the algorithm group clients based on the TFM variables' values.

The idea is to compare the result of these 2 methods and reach to a conclusion and action plan for the company.

## Datasets
In the folder "original_data" there are 2 datasets used in this analysis:
* Client dataset
* Sales dataset

The code I used to retrieve the data is in the notebook *"dataAcquisitionOdbc.ipynb"*. 

## Images
I saved the images created during the analysis in the folder *"images"*.
